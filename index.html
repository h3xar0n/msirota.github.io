            <h3>Integrative Genomics</h3>
            <p>With the advent of genotyping and whole genome sequencing technologies,
            more and more omics data is becoming available for integrative analysis and provides an opportunity to ask new questions about disease. We are interested in leveraging the genetic data across phenotypes to elucidate the;genetic architecture of disease with a special interest in autoimmune diseases (Plos Genetics 2009). Furthermore we are interested in leveraging and applying next-generation sequencing technologies in order to better understand the role of the immune system in disease (JCI 2012, STM 2014).</p>

            <h3>Cancer Informatics</h3>
            <p>We are interested in using publicly available gene expression and genetics data to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for cancer. We are actively working on developing computational approaches for target identification, therapeutic prediction and selection of validation models (CPT 2015, BMC Med Genomics 2015, PSB 2015). We have a special interest in studying the tumor microenvironment and the interaction of immune cells in the context of cancer (Nature Communications, 2015).</p>

            <h3>Computational Drug Discovery</h3>
            <p>The identification of novel disease indications for approved drugs, or drug repositioning, offers several advantages over traditional drug development. The traditional paradigm of drug discovery is generally regarded as protracted and costly, with studies showing that it takes approximately 15 years and over $1 billion to develop and bring a novel drug to market. The repositioning of drugs already approved for human use mitigates the costs and risks associated with early stages of drug development, and offers shorter routes to approval for therapeutic indications. We are interested in leveraging publicly available data to carry out data-driven computational drug repositioning (STM 2011, JID 2016).</p>

            <h3>Integrative Methods for Preterm Birth Research</h3>
            <p>Each year, 15 million babies (representing 10% of the world’s births) are born preterm, defined as before the 37th week of gestation. Survival for most children born preterm has improved considerably, but surviving children remain at increased risk for a variety of serious complications, many of which contribute to lifelong challenges for individuals and their families, as well as to burdensome economic costs to society. The exact mechanism of spontaneous preterm birth is unknown, though a variety of social, environmental, and maternal factors have been implicated in its cause. We are in particular interested in applying computational integrative methods to investigate the role of the immune system in pregnancy and elucidating genetic and environmental determinants of preterm birth. The March of Dimes funds lifesaving research and programs and works to end premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality.</p>

            <h3>Post-doctoral opportunities in Translational Bioinformatics at UCSF</h3>
            <p>
              The laboratory of Dr. Marina Sirota at UCSF is seeking highly motivated investigators to develop and study novel approaches in translational bioinformatics, or the application of analytic and interpretive methods to optimize the transformation of genomic and clinical data into precision medicine. We are currently recruiting investigators interested in focusing on using omics and integrative approaches to study pregnancy outcomes with a focus on preterm birth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideal candidates will have an M.D. and/or Ph.D. with a strong background in bioinformatics, computational biology, biostatistics, and genomics, and a great publication record.
            </p>
            <p>
              Strong problem-solving skills, creative thinking, and the ability to build new software tools as needed are required. Applicants must possess good communication skills and be fluent in both spoken and written English. A background in molecular biology or medicine or pharmacology will be a strong plus. Prior experience with genetic, microarray, drug, or clinical databases, text-mining, knowledge representation, or parallel computing platforms is a plus. This exciting work will be guided by multidisciplinary collaborations with top scientists in neonatology, genetics, environmental science, immunology and microbiome research at UCSF.
            </p>
            <p>
              To apply, please send your CV, a brief statement of research interests, and contact information for three references in one PDF document to <a href="mailto:marina.sirota@ucsf.edu">marina.sirota@ucsf.edu</a>.

            <h3>Rotation Students</h3>
            <p>The Sirota Lab has openings each quarter for rotating students.</p>
            <p>Expecations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You will be expected to spend close to the theoretical 50% working in the lab, and spend that 50% in our office-space in Mission Hall.</li>
              <li>You will meet with the PI on a bi-weekly basis.</li>
              <li>You will need to interact with the Post-doctoral Fellows and graduate students.</li>
              <li>You are expected to attend the weekly laboratory meetings.</li>
              <li>You will be expected to present to the laboratory in the presentation rotation.</li>
              <li>You are strongly encouraged to submit a paper on your work, even though it is just a rotation project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What you will learn:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is the open-source statistical software package we preferentially
               use.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a> is the scripting/programming language we preferentially use, because most of our programs are quite small. We use <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> for larger programs.</li>
              <li><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> is the open-source database software package we preferentially use.</li>
